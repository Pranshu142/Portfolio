### üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. This will help you explore the codebase and see the magic for yourself!

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** or **Bun** installed on your machine.

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Pranshu142/Portfolio.git]
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your EmailJS API keys. These keys are crucial for the contact form to work!

    ```dotenv
    VITE_Email_Service_ID="your_emailjs_service_id"
    VITE_Email_Template_ID="your_emailjs_template_id"
    VITE_Email_Public_Key="your_emailjs_public_key"
    ```

#### Getting Your EmailJS Keys

- **Service ID:** Go to the EmailJS dashboard and navigate to the **Email Services** tab to find your ID.
- **Template ID:** In the **Email Templates** tab, you'll find your unique template ID.
- **Public Key:** Your public key is available in the **Account** tab under "Account details."

#### Running the Project

To start the development server, run the command below. The page will automatically reload if you make changes.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# bun run dev
```

The application will be live at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the minified files ready for deployment.
